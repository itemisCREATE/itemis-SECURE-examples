## How to use? - itemis Excel template

Many users of our tool still manage data in Excel sheets. And we are aware of that fact. To ease the transition, we offer a standatized Excel template that _SECURE_ is able to import from.

This repository therefore also contains the latest version of this template filled with the same data as the ´ISOExample´ example project.

Within _SECURE_ you can select a model in the Project View and then go to `Import/Export | Import itemis Excel Template into Current Model...` and select the filled out template to import your data from our default Excel format.
